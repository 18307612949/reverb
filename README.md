Simple Reverb Plugin
====================

This is a simple experimental reverb plugin based on the principles outlined
in the CCRMA article on Schroeder's work.

No particular claims are made for its reliability, quality or performance.

There are (currently) three controls:

  Colour is a "tilt" EQ similar to that used on old Quad amps, rolling off the treble when turned down and bass when turned up
  Size adjusts the size of the "room", and to an extent its shape.
  Decay adjusts the feedback trim through the comb filters.

It has been tested with jack-rack, using the host's wet/dry mix to adjust reverb to a sensible level.
